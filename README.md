# ULab-Project
This project aims to explore the post binary star merger event GW170817. The light curve after merger event showed a quite significant turnover signature between 100-300 days, which may indicate a off-axis structured jets formation. 

We resort to model fitting for light curve to constraint parameter values from published papers and re-evaluate the effectiveness of different models.
